Note: The name of a layer in the Layers In Visio Drawing list is unavailable if that layer is included in the Layers In PDF list. When you select that layer in the Layers In PDF list, a bullet appears next to the layer\u2019s name in the Layers In Visio Drawing list. 4. Optionally, do any of the following: \u2022 To reorder the layers in the Layers In PDF list, drag an item up or down in the list. \u2022 To include a visibility property that can be switched on or off in Acrobat, deselect Locked On adjacent to the PDF layer; to lock the resulting PDF layer\u2019s visibility on, select Locked On. \u2022 To save the current settings of Visio layers selected, click Save PDF Settings , and click OK. These settings are used the next time you convert the current Visio file to a PDF file. 5. Click Convert To PDF, specify a folder in the Save In box in which to save the PDF file, type a filename, and then click Save. Note: Visio layers that were selected for conversion and that have Visio settings for visible, printable, or lock are converted to PDF layers; the visible and printable properties are included in the resulting PDF layers. If the Visio file contains a background page, header, or footer, the PDF file automatically has PDF layers named for those items. Convert AutoCAD files to PDF (Acrobat Pro for Windows) Use PDFMaker to convert AutoCAD files from within the AutoCAD application. You can also use the Batch Conversion feature to convert many AutoCAD files in one operation. Acrobat PDFMaker preserves selected layers and layouts when converting AutoCAD files to PDF. Convert AutoCAD files when AutoCAD is installed When converting individual AutoCAD files, you don't usually need to change page size and plotting settings. PDFMaker uses the appropriate layout page size and plotting information to create a correctly sized PDF file.",

If the PDF is generated from a scanned do cument, Acrobat automatically runs OCR to make the text and images editable. The Edit panel includes options to modify the page, add content, redact a PDF, and convert various documents to PDF forms. You can use the options in the Edit panel to replace, edit, or add text to a PDF. You can correct typos, change fonts and typeface si ze, adjust alignment, add superscripts or subscripts, and resize text or paragraphs. Set the default font for adding and editing text When you add text in a PDF, by default Acrobat chooses nearby font attributes for the new text. When you edit text, any f ont that isn't available on the system is substituted by a default fall-back font for the particular script. For example, Minion Pro is the default fall -back font for Roman script fonts. The substitution of unavailable fonts by default fonts can introduce inconsistency in the look and feel of text in a PDF document. To avoid inconsistency, choose a specific font for any text that is added or modified in the PDF document from Font Options under Content Editing. 1. From the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS), choose Preferences . The Preferences dialog box is displayed. (Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+K keys on Windows\u00ae or Command+K keys on macOS.) 2. In the dialog box, select Content Editing under Categories to display Font Options. 3.
